I graduated with a Masters degree in CS from ASU. I have more than 3.5 years of software development experience from Amazon and Fidelity Investments. During my undergraduate, I was the head of App Development team in the R&D club of my college called Spider, as part of which I conducted multiple workshops on Android App development and Web development. I also won few hackathons. 

My technology skills include Full Stack Web Development, Spring, Spring Boot, Java, Angular, Typescript, React, Camel, ActiveMQ, MySQL, MyBatis, Python, Django, Atlassian Tools(JIRA, Confluence, etc.), Agile.

Outside of technology, I love cooking, reading books, and am also experienced in doing improv comedy and sketch writing. I also love watching Dota2.
